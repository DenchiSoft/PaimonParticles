# PaimonParticles   ![](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/PaimonParticles/blob/main/img/miHoYo_genshin_2020.png)

My attempt to recreate the super pretty constellation-like particle effect used for **Paimon** from [Genshin Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact) in Unity. Feel free to use this in your own projects.

Web demo can be found here: https://denchi.itch.io/paimon-particle-demo

Partially based on _Mirza Beig's_ **"Plexus"** effect.
