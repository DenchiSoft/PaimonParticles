# PaimonParticles

My attempt to recreate the super pretty constellation-like particle effect used for Paimon from [Genshin Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact). Feel free to use this in your own projects.

Web demo can be found here: https://denchi.itch.io/paimon-particle-demo

Partially based on Mirza Beig's "Plexus" effect.
